Note to team members:
1. This project utilises both coreui (style.scss) and tailwind (style.css) for styling the web app
2. Default styling is coreui's scss (as seen in import './scss/style.scss' in App.js )
3. To use tailwind css, import in the file independently (for instance: import '../../css/style.css'; in DriverTable.js )
4. Main color code: #56844B

Libraries:
npm install tailwindcss@2 postcss@8 autoprefixer@10
